#### Lab01 : Electronic Piano
The piano generates a square wave at the specific frequency when the
corresponding key is pressed. For example, the piano generates a square wave at a frequency of
261.63 Hz when the key C is pressed. Since period is the inverse of frequency, the cycle duration of
the signal is 3.816 ms. In a cycle, the signal connected to the buzzer system is ON for 1.908 ms then
is OFF for 1.908 ms and so on. This applies to all piano keys, only the frequencies change<br>
<br>
Use your piano to play the song “twinkle twinkle little star” and 
Write a program that plays the song “twinkle twinkle little star” automatically.
