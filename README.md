#### Lab01 : Electronic Piano
The piano generates a square wave at the specific frequency when the corresponding key is pressed. For example, the piano generates a square wave at a frequency of
261.63 Hz when the key C is pressed. Since period is the inverse of frequency, the cycle duration of the signal is 3.816 ms. In a cycle, the signal connected to the buzzer system is ON for 1.908 ms then is OFF for 1.908 ms and so on. This applies to all piano keys, only the frequencies change<br>
<br>
Use your piano to play the song “twinkle twinkle little star” and Write a program that plays the song “twinkle twinkle little star” automatically.
#### Lab02 : Digital Watch
A 7-segment LED is an electronic device for displaying decimal numerals. These displays are
widely used in digital clocks, electronic meters, and basic calculators. In a typical 7-segment LED package,
all of the cathodes or all of the anodes of the segment LEDs are connected to a common pin. This is referred to as a "common cathode" or "common anode" device <br>
<br>
You are required to design and build a digital watch using an Arduino MCU. The digital watch you are required to build comprises two 7-segment LEDs that
display time in second. The watch has two modes: a clock mode and a stopwatch mode. The watch has three keys: mode, adjust/start, and reset.
